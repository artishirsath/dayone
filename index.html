    <h1>Day One</h1>
    <h3>1.Differance between div and span?</h3>
    <p> divtag stands for division tag and it is block-level element means it is bound
    to take the whole width of the screen. Its default CSS “display” property is
    “display : block”.
    </p>

    <p>span tag is an inline element means it only takes the space that is required for
    the content.. Its default CSS “display” property is “display : inline”.
   </p>

   <p><b>Div </b>is a block element and it acquires the entire width so the next element
    which will come, will always come in the next line. Whereas Span is an inline
    element, it acquires only the width which is required for the content so the next
    element will be starting from the same line only.

   <h3>2.Difference between class and IDs?</h3>
   <p>In HTML, the differences between class and ID is :</p>

   <ul>
    <li> One element can have more than one class i.e. class = “box box1”. On
       the other hand, one element can have only one id i.e. <b>id = “heading” #heading</b>
   </li>

   <li>IDs are unique which means you can not give one id to multiple elements.</li>

   <li>When we style an element using class we use <b>class = “box” .box{};</b> On
   the other hand to style an element using id we use<b> id = “heading”
   #heading</b>
   </li>
   </ul><hr>

   <h3>3.What are self-closing tags and empty elements?</h3>
   <p>In HTML, A self-closing tag is a type of tag that need not be closed by closing
    tag, which means there is no separate closing tag for it as </tag>.</p>

   <p>Normal tags require opening and closing tags both like div is an opening tag
  and div tag is a closing tag.</p>

  <p>Elements that don't have any content are called <b>empty elements.</b></p>

  <p> <b>br</b> is an <b>empty element</b> without a closing tag (the <b>br</b>tag defines a line
  break).</p>

  <p>Empty elements can be <b>"closed"</b> in the opening tag like this: <br />.
  Example: <b>pre,img ,input ,br,hr,pre</b></p><hr>

  <h3>4. How many types of heading tags are there? How to decide which to use
  where?
  </h3>
  <p>Heading tags are titles or subtitles that we want to display on our webpage.
 There are <b>six</b> levels of heading tags are there in HTML. These tags play an
 important role in making your website SEO(search engine optimization)
  friendly.
  <b>h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6</b>
  </p>

   <p>: h1 tag you should when you want to give the main heading of the page.</p>

   <p>: h2 h3 tags you should use to give the sub-headings in the page.</p>

    <p>: h4 h5 h6 tags you should use to give the content.</p>

   highest importance and h6 is of least importance.</p><hr>

   property is “display : block”.</p>

    <p>The strong tag should be used to indicate strong importance. It makes text
        look bold. i.e.<b>text</b></p>
    <p>The em tag should be used to represent stress emphasis, like when you'd read
        the emphasized text in a different tone of voice. This also makes the text look

    emphasis. i.e Text</p><hr>

        an element by giving space between two attributes.</p>

    <p>Ex : img src=”http://www.google.com/morning-img” alt=”image”/</p>

    <p>Here src and alt are attributes of img tag.</p><hr>
